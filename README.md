# projectBars.io
This is a small project for my class back in 2017. It is a fairly simple website that managed a database by using C.R.U.D. 

To gain access to any of the web pages, simply type: https://yeja94.github.io/projectBar/[the name of the file] you wish to see. 
Example: https://yeja94.github.io/projectBar/main.html
